  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
  - Naive Bayes
  - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)
  
- **Unsupervised Learning**
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Hierarchical Clustering
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
